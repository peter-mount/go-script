    <p>
        go-script is a simple extensible scripting language which can be embedded within an application, allowing it to be either customised by the user or
        as the main focus of that application.
    </p>
    <p>
        Examples of this are go-anim which allows for vector graphics to be produced from a script and either written to an image or a video clip.
    </p>
    <p>
        piweather.center extends go-anim to allow for animations to be generated from captured weather data. For example a webcam of the sky showing the
        weather conditions during the day along with the measurements captured during that day as it progresses.
