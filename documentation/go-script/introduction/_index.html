<p>
    go-script is a simple, but extensible scripting language based primarily on C with
    some concepts taken from Go, Java and JavaScript as well as its own concepts.
</p>

<p>
    Some of the basic concepts used are listed below.
    These concepts will be described in full in later sections:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>General structure of a script is based loosely on C</li>
    <li>
        Scripts are not type safe, variables, function parameters and return types
        can be any valid go type.
    </li>
    <li>
        Functions are declared simply by defining their name, named arguments required
        and the function's body. No return type is specified
    </li>
    <li>
        The <code>main()</code> function defines the entry point for the script.
    </li>
    <li>
        Scripts can include other scripts with the <code>include</code> statement.
        It is safe to include a script twice as it will only be read once.
    </li>
    <li>
        Scripts can declare a function as local to itself by starting the function name
        with <code>_</code>. Any such function is only accessible from inside that script.
        This is useful when writing library scripts where only the public entry points
        are accessible.
    </li>
    <li>
        Variables are scoped, so they are only accessible within the block they are declared
        within or inner scopes.
        Functions cannot access variables declared outside of it's body.
    </li>
    <li>
        Error handling is done similar to Java using a try statement.
        The try statement works in a similar way to Java and can even be used to ensure
        a resource is closed once the try completes.
    </li>
    <li>
        For loops are based on both C and Go semantics.
    </li>
    <li>
        Extensions to the language are done via packages, which are Go structs which
        expose either public fields or functions.
        The parent application declares these and registers them so scripts can access
        them like any other function but using the registered prefix.
    </li>
</ul>
