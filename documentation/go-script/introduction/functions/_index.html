<p>
    In <em>go-script</em> a function declares a reusable block of code which takes
    a fixed number of parameters and can optionally return a value.
</p>

<h2 class="subsection">Declaring a function</h2>

<p>
    In a script you simply declare a function by specifying its name, any parameters
    within parentheses and a block of statements.
</p>
<div class="sourceCode">myfunction() {
    // code goes here
}
</div>

<div class="marginNote">
    These variables are only accessible from within the body of the function.<br/>
    They cannot be accessed outside the function, nor from any function that is called by this function.
</div>
<p>
    Parameters are placed within the parentheses.
    Because the language is not type safe you only need to declare the variable names
    they will be referenced by within the function.
</p>
<div class="sourceCode">myfunction( param1, param2 ) {
    // code goes here
}
</div>

<h3 class="paragraph">Returning values</h3>
<p>
    A function can return a single value via the <code>return</code> statement.
</p>
<div class="sourceCode">myfunction( param1, param2 ) {
    return param1
}
</div>

<p>
    Because <code>return</code> only allows a single value, to return more than one value you need to use either an array or a map.
</p>

<h2 class="subsubsection">Local functions</h2>
<p>
    Function names are global in scope, so if you include another script via the <code>include</code> statement then it's functions
    are available to your script.
</p>
<p>
    To allow for a script to create functions only it will be able to call we have the concept of local functions.
    These are functions whose name begins with a <code>_</code> character.
    These functions are only callable from within the script they are defined in.
</p>

<h2 class="subsection">The main function</h2>
<p>
    If you want your script to be executable from the command line you need to declare the <code>main()</code> function.
</p>
<p>
    It takes no parameters and is not expected to have a value returned from it.
    With this function present you can call the script from your application.
</p>
<p>
    <code>main()</code> is special in that it is local to the script it was defined in.
    This allows for scripts to have their own <code>main()</code> function which will be ignored if those scripts
    are then included from another script.
