<p>
    <code>for</code> provides the main means of performing loops.
    The other loop construct is the <code>while</code> statement.
</p>

<div class="marginNote">
    If a <code>break</code> statement is executed whilst within the <code>for</code> statement then the loop is terminated.
    However the <code>break</code> will only terminate the immediate <code>for</code> loop it is in.
</div>

<h3 class="paragraph">Syntax</h3>
<pre><strong>for</strong> <em>init</em> <strong>;</strong> <em>condition</em> <strong>;</strong> <em>increment</em> <em>statement</em>
<strong>for</strong> <em>index</em> <strong>,</strong> <em>value</em> <strong>:= range</strong> <em>expression</em> <em>statement</em>
<strong>for</strong> <em>index</em> <strong>,</strong> <em>value</em> <strong>= range</strong> <em>expression</em> <em>statement</em>
</pre>

<h2 class="subsection">C style for statement</h2>

<p>
    The first form is the traditional C style <code>for</code> statement.
    Here it consists of 3 parameters followed by the <em>statement</em> to execute.
</p>
<p>
    The <em>init</em> expression allows you to initialise the loop, usually by setting a variable to it's staring value.
</p>

<div class="marginNote">
    The expression is true when the result of the expression is either a boolean true, a non 0 numerical value
    or one of the following strings: "true", "t", "yes" or "y"
</div>
<p>
    Next is the <em>condition</em> expression which determines if the <em>statement</em> is to be executed.
    If this condition returns false then the loop is terminated.
</p>

<p>
    Finally, there's the <em>increment</em> expression which is called after the <em>statement</em> has executed.
    It usually increments (or decrements) the variable created in the <em>init</em> expression
</p>

<h3 class="paragraph">Examples</h3>

<p>The following code will print out the numbers 1 to 10:</p>
<div class="marginNote">
    You cannot use <code>i++</code> here as the <code>++</code> and <code>--</code> operators from C are not implemented.
</div>
<div class="sourceCode">for i:=1; i<=10; i=i+1 {
    fmt.Println(a)
}
</div>

<h2 class="subsection">Go style for range statement</h2>

<div class="marginNote">When iterating over a map the <em>index</em> variable will hold the key rather than the index within the loop.</div>
<p>
    As with <code>Go</code>, you can loop over an Array or Map.
    Unlike <code>Go</code> the language also supports an Iterator value as the value source.
    In this form you provide two variable names to hold the <em>index</em> and <em>value</em> of each entry as the loop iterates over the source value.
</p>

<p>
    If you do not want to use either of <em>index</em> and <em>value</em> can use <code>_</code> to indicate you don't care for that value.
    This is preferable as it doesn't use any additional memory creating a variable you are not going to use.
    However, unlike <code>Go</code>, you have to declare both fields. You cannot leave out the <em>index</em> parameter.
</p>

<p>
    The <code>:=</code> declares that the two variables are to be created within the scope of the <code>for</code> loop, regardless of if they already
    exist. When this form is used and either of those variables already exist outside the loop, the external variables are untouched.
</p>
<p>
    However, if the <code>=</code> form is used, then if either of the variables exist outside the loop then they will be overwritten by the for loop.
    If they do not exist then they will only exist from within the loop.
</p>

<h3 class="paragraph">Arrays</h3>
<p>
    As in GO, when an array is passed to the statement, the loop will run with the <em>index</em> and <em>value</em> of each element
    passed it.
</p>

<h3 class="paragraph">Maps</h3>
<p>
    As in GO, when a map is passed to the statement, the loop will run with the <em>key</em> and <em>value</em> of each element
    passed to it.
    The <em>key</em>, <em>value</em> pairs passed to the loop will be in the natural order of the map.
</p>

<h3 class="paragraph">Iterator</h3>
<p>
    If the value implements the <code>Iterator</code> interface then the loop will run whilst the
    <code>HasNext()</code> function returns true.
</p>
<p>
    The <em>value</em> passed to the loop will be the value returned by the <code>Next()</code> function.
    The <em>index</em> passed will be a counter starting from 0.
</p>

<div class="sourceCode">type Iterator interface {
    HasNext() bool
    Next() interface{}
}
</div>

<h3 class="paragraph">Iterable</h3>
<p>
    If the value implements the <code>Iterable</code> interface then an iterator will be obtained
    from the <code>Iterator()</code> function and it will then be used as above for <code>Iterator</code>.
</p>

<div class="sourceCode">type Iterable interface {
    Iterator() Iterator
}
</div>

<h3 class="paragraph">Examples</h3>
<p>To iterate over an array:</p>
<div class="sourceCode">array := newArray()
array=append(array, 1, 2, 3, 4)

// Print both index and value
for i,v := range array {
    fmt.Printf("%d = %d\n", i, v)
}

// Example of ignoring the index and processing just the values
for _, v := range array {
    fmt.Println( v)
}
</div>

<p>To iterate over a map:</p>
<div class="sourceCode">m := map( "a":1, "b":2, "c": 3.1415926 )

// Example of printing both key and value
for k, v := range m {
    fmt.Printf("%s = %d\n", k, v)
}

// Example of ignoring the keys
for _, v := range m {
    fmt.Println( v )
}

// Example of ignoring the values
for k, _ := range m {
    fmt.Println( k )
}
</div>

<p>
    The next example is unusual but perfectly valid.
    Here we use <code>_</code> for both fields.
    This has the effect of running the body once per entry within the array or map,
    however the body doesn't use the values at all.
</p>
<div class="sourceCode">m := map( "a":1, "b":2, "c": 3.1415926 )

for _, _ := range m {
    fmt.Println( "Entry found" )
}
</div>
