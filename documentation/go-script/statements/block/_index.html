<p>
    Wherever a <em>statement</em> is expected, you can place a set of statements wrapped within a pair of <code>{ }</code>.
</p>

<p>
    This is useful in many ways, mainly within loops, conditionals etc. where you need multiple statements, or to define the scope of variables.
</p>

<p>
    When it comes to variables, any variable that is declared within a <code>{ }</code> block will only be visible within that block.
    When the block terminates, those variables are lost.
