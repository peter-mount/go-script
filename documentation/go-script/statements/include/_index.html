<p>
    <code>include</code> is a statement that is executed when a script is parsed and
    allows you to include another script within your own.
</p>
<div class="marginNote">
    Included scripts are normally located in the <code>../include</code> directory
    as seen from the location of the application binary.
</div>

<h3 class="paragraph">Syntax</h3>
<pre><strong>include</strong> "<em>path/script</em>"</pre>

<p>
    When importing another script, all of its public functions are then accessible by the script when it is executed.
    Because of this, public function names must be unique.
    Private names are local to the individual script they are written in so do not have this limitation.
